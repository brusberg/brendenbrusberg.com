        I am not trying to be a data science influencer, but I do want to create, collaborate, and share. Reach out if you want to work with me!

        I am ok with how clunky and awkwark things may look. I am a big believer in just starting the process first before thinking it through too much. Hopefully if I cringe looking back it means I've grown in the future :) I gotta start somewhere.
