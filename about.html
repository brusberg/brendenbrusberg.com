    <p>
        I am a Data Science Specialist at McKinsey & Company building ML platforms for People Analytics. I have expertise in deep learning in NLP, unsupervised modeling, software/cloud architecture, and CI/CD.

        In December 2021, I received my Masters in Machine Learning from Stevens Institute of Technology. I received my Bachelors in Computer Science from Stevens Institute of Technology in May 2021 with a minor in Mathematics and a minor in Literature, mostly poetry!

        I do want to create, collaborate, and share. Reach out if you want to work with me! I am not trying to be a data science influencer, but I do think documenting and sharing my learnings and experiences is important and hopefully can help others as well!
