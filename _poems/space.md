6 years, 5 months, 12 days \
A grand journey set forth for adventure. \
A voyage for sights that would chill to the bone. \
To be an explorer of the unknown.

Yet from zenith to nadir, \
Every possible horizon has already been known. \
And I had no idea!

I'd be in charge of watching her cargo,  \
If only I had known, \
I’d think it’d be luckier to be blown across Leo.

But God’s speed! \
Every moment accommodates, \
when you are first mate.

Heed fast! \
Your life is for the ship, so don’t fail \
or the captain will be on your tail.

… yet in the never ending bustle,  \
You’ll come across its graveyard,  \
and time will freeze.

The numbing silence of the cosmos will dampen even any rustle. \
And the sites of old ship’s long scarred, \
entails a fate worse than sailing the seven seas.

I hopped on the microphone: \
“Hailing unknown vessel, this is Freighter-00G8“ \
“Come in unknown vessel, this is Freighter-00G8“ \
Yet no reply in this no go zone.

We stared for hours, and prepared for orders. \
Finally approaching the brig; the ship’s pilot. \
And without reason he whispers \
“It’s pirates”

And the last thing he said to me, \
“You know, a watched pot never boils” \
Before we were hit with their laser coil.

And as the cabin depressurized, \
There was no more struggle. \
The air from my lungs fizzled, \
and I finally saw that I could bubble.
