    <h1>Poetry</h1>
    <p>
        During my undergraduate degree at Stevens, I somehow found myself in a poetry class and fell in love with it. I ended up taking every single poetry class until I had to take independent study credit hours, spending a whole semester on just the poem Song of Myself by Walt Whitman. This is how I accidentally received a minor in literature.

        However, all my classes were about reading and analyzing poetry, so now every week, my friends and I try to write one, share it, and give each other feedback. Here is a selection of poems that I have written.
